title: "Handwriting Recognition Through Machine Learning"
---

<!--more-->
A machine learning model to recognize digits written by hand. The model was trained using the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)  
[see project](/HandwritingML)
<!--more-->


This model was trained using a fairly naive algorithm and as such has some limitations:
 - Cannot determine if the figure is a digit or not
 - If an invalid input is submitted the model will (humourously) attempt to identify it as a digit 

This project was completed as a part of CMU's [18100 Introduction to ECE](/coursework) and as such the code is not viewable inorder to preserve academic integrity
