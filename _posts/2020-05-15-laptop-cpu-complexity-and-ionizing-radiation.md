### Abstract
It’s been known for some time that ionizing radiation frequent in space has detrimental effects on the performance and lifetime of electronics in the space environment [1]. Current understanding of electronic theory suggests that the trend of rising computer complexity of the commercial market will lead to greater vulnerability to Single Event Effects (SEE’s) in spaceflight [1],[2]. Thus, if a consumer market trends persist, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Computers will no longer be viable for use on future missions like the ISS or Artemis. However, this meta-analysis of testing previously done on the HP Zbook 15 G2 [3], Surface Pro 5 [4] and the Lenovo ThinkPad T61P [5] has shown that there is moderate positive linear correlation between CPU clock speed and stability under SEE’s. However, a Pearson Coefficient of 0.629 was determined to not be statistically significant. Additionally, there was a moderate negative correlation between lithography processes and stability under SEE’s. Although, again, a Pearson Coefficient of -0.578 was determined to not be statistically significant. These results demonstrate that newer more complex commercial CPU’s may in fact be more stable under SEE’s compared to older models. However, this trend is more likely a result of changes in the topology of transistors in the sub-22nm node, and other material, architectural, and manufacturing differences.
