title: "Optimal Pathing for the VEX IQ game \"Rise Above\" "
---
To the VEXIQ students, I realize this may go over many of your heads, possibly due to my poor explanations, but I encourage you to stick through it. You’ll likely find it very interesting.

To the VEXIQ coaches, I, unlike many of you, am not a professional teacher. But this game presents a great opportunity to introduce to students some of the higher level topics in robotics: navigation, machine learning, and the famous Traveling Salesman Problem. This is a great time to expose students to new topics, and I hope you will do a better job than me to teach this.

Entertain for a moment a bored high school senior. Upon hearing the prompt of this year’s game, my first question was “What color configuration scores the most points while traveling the least distances?” This might seem trivial at first (I certainly thought it was), but is actually a pretty interesting problem.
