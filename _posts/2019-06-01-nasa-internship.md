title: "ICESat 1 and ICESat 2 NASA SEES Internship"
---
During the summer of 2019 I had the opportunity to work with the ICESat-1 and [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satelite projects under Dr. Tim Urban through the [SEES high school internship program](http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/sees-internship/). 
Our project was presented internally at the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Space Research and at the 2020 MIT Undergraduate Research and Technology Conference.
